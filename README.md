# Experimenting
Literally just trying to figure this shit out.
Still have yet to figure out the function of this website.

After experimentation, I have ascertained the general purpose of this website and have a basic understanding that it is functionally useless for my purposes at this time.

At least I have a new skill associated with high level group projects.

Here's hoping I use this knowledge at some point in the future.

Irregardless, I appreciate this opportunity to learn something new; farewell.
